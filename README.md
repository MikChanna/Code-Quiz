# Code-Quiz

This project is a coding quiz that was coded from scratch. The quiz includes multiple choice questions about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The point of this quiz game is to receive the highest score by being both fast and accurate. For everytime there is an incorrect answer, time will be deducted by 10 seconds. At the end of the quiz, the player will be prompted to enter their initials and the score will be shown and saved in the localStorage.

Disclaimer: Time conintues to countdown even when all questions have been answered. Highscores were unable to append to the leaderboard.

Here is a screenshot of the start up screen below.
